          <p class="lead text-center">The following sections describe how to use Handbell Stadium as a simulator for practising.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Setting up your computer</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Download the appropriate version of Handbell Stadium for your computer from <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a>.</li>
            <li>Find the downloaded zip file and unzip all its contents into a folder.</li>
            <li>Create a shortcut to the Handbell Stadium executable and put it in an easily accessible
              place, such as on your task bar or start menu.</li>
            <li>Plug in your two dummy handbells/motion controllers to USB ports and check that they are recognised as joysticks by your Operating System.</li>
            <li>Check your system output device for sound is selected for what you want e.g. speakers or headphones.</li>
            <li>Run Handbell Stadium.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Checking your controllers are working correctly</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Select Handbell Stadium Options and click the Input tab.</li>
              <li>Click the dropdown on the first DeviceId, you should see at least two motion controller devices listed.</li>
              <li>If there is only one or none, unplug your controllers, wait 20 seconds and reinsert them. Repeat from step 1.</li>
              <li>Select left and right controller from dropdowns making sure that you have selected different numbered motion controller devices.</li>
              <li>If your controllers are working, and the window has focus (click on it), then the numbers in the green boxes should move
                independently as you move each controller.</li>
              <li>Leave the other values as their defaults if you are using ActionXL wired controllers.</li>
              <li>Click DONE, then PRACTICE.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Choosing a Room and Method</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>There are three rooms to choose from to ring in. The Basement, the Lounge, and a Black Box. Which of these you choose is purely
                  a matter of personal preference. Some may be clearer to ring with than others depending on the quality of graphics on your computer.</li>
                <li>Click on METHOD to select the method you wish to ring, or leave it as the default method, Plain Bob Minor.</li>
                <li>To choose any other method, your computer needs to be connected to the internet, as it will retrieve methods from <a href="https://complib.org">Composition Library</a>
                where over 20,000 rung methods on 4-12 bells are available.</li>
                <li>If you are learning to ring handbells from scratch, and are looking for Plain Hunt, then type Original, as Original is
                  the name for plain hunt when rung as a method (Original Minor is plain hunt on six bells).</li>
                <li>You only need to type as many word fragments in the select method box as is necessary to display the method in the short list, before selecting it.</li>
                <li>If you select an odd-bell method, a tenor behind is assumed, to give an even number of bells.</li>
                <li> Click START to be put in the room with your bells.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Checking Your Bells are Working</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>If everything is set up correctly, the pair of bells immediately in front of you should ring when you swing your controllers
                  up and down like a handbell.
                </li>
                <li>If not, and Handbell Stadium is running in a Window, it must have focus, so click on it.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Room Controls</h3>
              <h4>Pair</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>This is the button showing two handbells and your current pair.</li>
                <li>Each time you click the pair button you will move round clockwise to the next pair.</li>
                <li>The pair button also controls which bells have lines drawn through them in the blue line display, even if you are not ringing them yourself.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Autopilot</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>This is the button showing an aircraft.</li>
                <li>If the button is displaying off, then your controllers are operating the two bells shown on the Pair button.</li>
                <li>If the button is displaying on, then the computer will ring the displayed pair, and your controllers are disabled.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Blue Line</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>This is the button showing a pair of lines.</li>
                <li>If the button is showing off, then the blue line display is off.</li>
                <li>If the button is showing on, then the rows being rung are displayed in a transparent panel on the right hand side of your screen
                  with lines drawn through your pair.</li> 
                <li>A red and blue line are shown for the trebles and green and blue line for the other pairs.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Speed Slider</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>This controls the speed of ringing, and is the final control in the bottom left hand panel.</li>
                <li>The speed of ringing is measured as the equivalent peal speed (calculated as the time to ring 5040 changes).</li>
                <li>Drag the slider right to go faster or left to go slower.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Keyboard Controls and Motion Controller Buttons</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>The space bar, G or left-hand controller button will cycle through Start/Go/Reset, so press once to ring rounds, press it again to start ringing
                  changes, and a third time to stop and reset the bells to handstroke rest.</li>
                <li>The pause key, P or right-hand controller button will pause and resume ringing without restarting from the beginning.</li>
                <li>The F9 or R key will stop ringing and reset the bells to handstroke rest.</li>
                <li>Pressing T is the same as clicking the autopilot button.</li>
                <li>Pressing C is the same as clicking the camera button.</li>
                <li>Pressing B is the same as clicking the blue line button.</li>
                <li>Pressing H displays or hides the avatars (men in black).</li>
                <li>Pressing N hides your own pair from view, provided that the camera is set to <i>POV</i>.</li>
                <li>Lower case letters work exactly the same as upper case.</li>
                <li>Pressing Options/Help will display a reminder of these functions.</li>
              </ol>
